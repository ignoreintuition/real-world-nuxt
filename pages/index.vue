        This site is designed to allow you to build decks for Uwe Rosenbergs
        three classic games from his harvest series: Agricola, La Havre, and At
        the Gates of Loyang. One of the greatest aspects of these games is the
        ability to play them as a single player experience. In doing so,
        however, it can often be a challenge to decide the best cards to use to
        maximize your points. Or, if you want to challenge someone to best your
        hight score, you migth want to decide on the specific hand to play with
        as opposed to drafting a hand. This tool allows you to compare / create
        a hand that maximizing the playing experience.
